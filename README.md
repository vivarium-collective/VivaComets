# Vivarium-COMETS

## Description
Vivarium-COMETS is a multiscale modeling project that leverages the capabilities of the Vivarium package to implement the 
COMETS methodology. This project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing complex 
microbial systems in spatial environments, enhancing our understanding of dynamic interactions within various 
environments.

## Features
- **Implementation of the COMETS Methodology Using Vivarium:** Utilizes the robust features of Vivarium to bring the COMETS methodology to life.
- **Analysis and Visualization Capabilities:** Includes advanced capabilities for analyzing system interactions, with a focus on Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This allows for the detailed examination and visualization of metabolic fluxes within the system, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes.
